## How I Trained the Models
For this project, I trained different models to generate images, sounds, and language for fictional beasts. For the visuals, I used a GAN trained on a mix of animal hybrids and mythological creatures. The idea was to create something that felt organic but still otherworldly. The sound part involved training a model on real animal noises, then tweaking them with effects like pitch shifts and reverb to make them feel more alien. For the language, I fine-tuned a transformer-based model on fantasy and ancient texts so it could generate unique-sounding words and descriptions.

## How I Created the Beasts
The images came from the GAN, but I didn’t stop there—I did some post-processing in Photoshop to clean them up, tweak colors, and add details where needed. The sounds were made by taking real-world animal recordings and running them through synthesis techniques to make them growl, screech, or purr in weird, unexpected ways. I used tools like Audacity to further refine them. The language model was prompted with structured linguistic rules so it wouldn’t just spit out random gibberish but instead create words that felt consistent and believable.
## Notes
While this was a fun project, I was not able to get somewhat creative outcomes as the training took very long. That being said, I ran around 3 epocs in the end which allowed me to get some clear and somewhat cool images based on dogs. As for the sound, I ended up using sound waves to make up for the creature sound.
